# Description

The code should take integers from defined range e.g. 0-100 and process them as follows.

- If a number is divisible by 3, print “Global”
- If a number is divisible by 5, print “Logic”
- If a number is divisible by 3 AND by 5, print “GlobalLogic” in a single line
- Each printout should be done on a separate line.

Expected results:

4 | 4
5 | Logic
6 | Global
